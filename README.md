## FAQ
### Do I need to run it manually everytime I turn on my pc?
No, it should start on its own and load the changes from the last time used.

In a .txt file in %APPDATA%/WallpaperChanger/
### I moved my files and now the software does not start after booting windows.
Running app.bat again should solve this issue.
